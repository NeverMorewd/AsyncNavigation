# 🚀 AsyncNavigation

[English](./README.md) | [中文文档](./README_zh-cn.md)

> A lightweight asynchronous navigation framework based on **Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection**

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧭 **Fully Asynchronous Navigation**  
  Natively supports `async/await`, making navigation and asynchronous operations seamless and intuitive.

- 💬 **Built-in DialogService**  
  Provides asynchronous methods for window and dialog navigation.

- ⛔ **Supports Cancellation**  
  Built-in `CancellationToken` support allows safe cancellation of navigation at any time.

- 🎨 **Customizable Navigation Indicators**  
  Developers can define custom indicators to visualize navigation states such as *loading*, *error*, or *completed*.

- 🧩 **Multiple Built-in Region Types**  
  In addition to standard single-page navigation based on `ContentControl`, also supports `ItemsControl` and `TabControl`.

- 🧱 **RegionAdapter Extension Mechanism**  
  Extend and customize navigation behaviors by implementing your own `RegionAdapter`.

- 🎛️ **Fine-grained Control Options**  
  Offers rich configuration options to make navigation behavior align precisely with application needs.

- 🧠 **Lifecycle Management**  
  Automatically handles view creation, caching, and release — effectively preventing memory leaks.

- 🧩 **Highly Abstract Core Layer**  
  Core logic is encapsulated within abstractions, minimizing platform-specific code and improving testability.

- ⚙️ **Minimal Dependencies**  
  Depends only on `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions (>= 8.0)`.

- 🕊 **Framework-Agnostic**  
  Works with any MVVM or UI framework, giving developers complete freedom of choice.
